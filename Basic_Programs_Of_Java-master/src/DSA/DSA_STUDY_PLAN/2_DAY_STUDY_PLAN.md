## 📝 **Study Tips for Maximum Retention**

### **Active Learning Techniques:**
1. ✅ **Explain out loud** - Pretend you're teaching someone
2. ✅ **Write on paper** - Don't just read code, write it
3. ✅ **Draw diagrams** - Visualize architectures
4. ✅ **Connect to experience** - Relate everything to your current work

### **Time Management:**
- ⏰ **Pomodoro Technique:** 45 mins study + 15 mins break
- ⏰ **Don't get stuck:** If a topic takes >30 mins, move on and come back
- ⏰ **Prioritize breadth over depth:** Better to know 80% of everything than 100% of one thing

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't try to memorize code line-by-line
- ❌ Don't spend hours on one DSA problem
- ❌ Don't read everything word-for-word (scan code examples)
- ❌ Don't stay up all night before interview
