3. ‚úÖ **Draw diagrams** - Visualize architectures
4. ‚úÖ **Connect to experience** - Relate everything to your current work

### **Time Management:**
- ‚è∞ **Pomodoro Technique:** 45 mins study + 15 mins break
- ‚è∞ **Don't get stuck:** If a topic takes >30 mins, move on and come back
- ‚è∞ **Prioritize breadth over depth:** Better to know 80% of everything than 100% of one thing

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ‚ùå Don't try to memorize code line-by-line
- ‚ùå Don't spend hours on one DSA problem
- ‚ùå Don't read everything word-for-word (scan code examples)
- ‚ùå Don't stay up all night before interview
